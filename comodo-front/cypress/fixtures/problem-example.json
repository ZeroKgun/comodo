There are three cups and one ball. Put the ball into a random cup and keep changing the cups randomly. It just stops at some point while changing, and at that time, the audience just has to choose a cup with a ball in it.</p><p>If you hit where the ball is, you pay 10x, not 2x. Yoon-seong, who was very tempted by the reward, could not avoid placing a bet.</p><p>However, it did not become a legend of Yabawi for nothing. Steven Gerrard never places the ball where the spectator picks it up for a single game. The trick is so great that no one in the audience will notice.</p><p>Yoon-seong continues to bet, but gets tired and angry and leaves. This is the situation when -1 is entered in the problem.</p><p>Let's write a program that prints out how much money Yoon-seong threw away before he left.</p>",
